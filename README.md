## 1. Getting started

Fork this repo and clone it on your computer,`git clone`. 

## 2. Challenge
In this challenge we are going to determine whether a number can be considered narcissistic.
A [Narcissistic Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number) is a number which is the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. 

### 2.1 Examples
An example for a narcissistic number is 153 (3 digits):
```
1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
```

### 2.2. Testing your solution
To test your solution, run `npm i` in the root directory and then run `npm t` to run the automated tests.

### 2.3. Submitting your solution

Once you're finished `git push` and submit a pull request to: 
`https://github.com/jonas-wedemeyer/does-my-number-look-big-in-this.git`
